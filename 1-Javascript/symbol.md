#### Symbol type
a symbol is a "primitive unique value" with an optional description. Let's see where we can use them.

By specification, only two primitive types may serve as object property keys:
- string type, or
- symbol type.

Otherwise, if one uses another type, such as number, it's autoconverted to string. So that `obj[1]` is the same as `obj["1"]`, and `obj[true]` is the same as `obj["true"]`.
```js
// a "symbol" represents a unique identifier.
let id = Symbol();

// Upon creation, we can give symbols a description (also called a symbol name), mostly useful for debugging purposes:
let id = Symbol("id");
```
```
let id1 = Symbol("id");
let id2 = Symbol("id");

alert(id1 == id2); // false
```
```
let id = Symbol("id");
alert(id); // TypeError: Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string
```
```
let id = Symbol("id");
alert(id.toString()); // Symbol(id), now it works
alert(id.description); // id
```
Symbols allow us to create "hidden" properties of an object, that no other part of code can accidentally access or overwrite.

For instance, if we're working with `user` objects, that belong to a third-party code. We'd like to add identifiers to them.

Let's use a symbol key for it:

```js run
let user = { // belongs to another code
  name: "John"
};

let id = Symbol("id");

user[id] = 1;

alert( user[id] ); // we can access the data using the symbol as the key
```

What's the benefit of using `Symbol("id")` over a string `"id"`?

As `user` objects belong to another codebase, it's unsafe to add fields to them, since we might affect pre-defined behavior in that other codebase. However, symbols cannot be accessed accidentally. The third-party code won't be aware of newly defined symbols, so it's safe to add symbols to the `user` objects.

Also, imagine that another script wants to have its own identifier inside `user`, for its own purposes.

Then that script can create its own `Symbol("id")`, like this:

```js
// ...
let id = Symbol("id");

user[id] = "Their id value";
```

There will be no conflict between our and their identifiers, because symbols are always different, even if they have the same name.

...But if we used a string `"id"` instead of a symbol for the same purpose, then there *would* be a conflict:

```js
let user = { name: "John" };

// Our script uses "id" property
user.id = "Our id value";

// ...Another script also wants "id" for its purposes...

user.id = "Their id value"
// Boom! overwritten by another script!
```

### Symbols are skipped by for..in
Symbolic properties do not participate in `for..in` loop.
```
let id = Symbol("id");
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  [id]: 123
};

for (let key in user) alert(key); // name, age (no symbols)

// the direct access by the symbol works
alert( "Direct: " + user[id] ); // Direct: 123
```

[Object.keys(user)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys) also ignores them. That's a part of the general "hiding symbolic properties" principle. If another script or a library loops over our object, it won't unexpectedly access a symbolic property.

In contrast, [Object.assign](mdn:js/Object/assign) copies both string and symbol properties:

```js run
let id = Symbol("id");
let user = {
  [id]: 123
};

let clone = Object.assign({}, user);

alert( clone[id] ); // 123
```

There's no paradox here. That's by design. The idea is that when we clone an object or merge objects, we usually want *all* properties to be copied (including symbols like `id`).

## Global symbols

As we've seen, usually all symbols are different, even if they have the same name. But sometimes we want same-named symbols to be same entities. For instance, different parts of our application want to access symbol `"id"` meaning exactly the same property.

To achieve that, there exists a *global symbol registry*. We can create symbols in it and access them later, and it guarantees that repeated accesses by the same name return exactly the same symbol.

In order to read (create if absent) a symbol from the registry, use `Symbol.for(key)`.

That call checks the global registry, and if there's a symbol described as `key`, then returns it, otherwise creates a new symbol `Symbol(key)` and stores it in the registry by the given `key`.

For instance:

```js run
// read from the global registry
let id = Symbol.for("id"); // if the symbol did not exist, it is created

// read it again (maybe from another part of the code)
let idAgain = Symbol.for("id");

// the same symbol
alert( id === idAgain ); // true
```

Symbols inside the registry are called *global symbols*. If we want an application-wide symbol, accessible everywhere in the code -- that's what they are for.

### Symbol.keyFor

We have seen that for global symbols, `Symbol.for(key)` returns a symbol by name. To do the opposite -- return a name by global symbol -- we can use: `Symbol.keyFor(sym)`:

For instance:

```js run
// get symbol by name
let sym = Symbol.for("name");
let sym2 = Symbol.for("id");

// get name by symbol
alert( Symbol.keyFor(sym) ); // name
alert( Symbol.keyFor(sym2) ); // id
```

The `Symbol.keyFor` internally uses the global symbol registry to look up the key for the symbol. So it doesn't work for non-global symbols. If the symbol is not global, it won't be able to find it and returns `undefined`.

That said, all symbols have the `description` property.

For instance:

```js run
let globalSymbol = Symbol.for("name");
let localSymbol = Symbol("name");

alert( Symbol.keyFor(globalSymbol) ); // name, global symbol
alert( Symbol.keyFor(localSymbol) ); // undefined, not global

alert( localSymbol.description ); // name
```

## System symbols

There exist many "system" symbols that JavaScript uses internally, and we can use them to fine-tune various aspects of our objects.

They are listed in the specification in the [Well-known symbols](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-well-known-symbols) table:

- `Symbol.hasInstance`
- `Symbol.isConcatSpreadable`
- `Symbol.iterator`
- `Symbol.toPrimitive`
- ...and so on.

For instance, `Symbol.toPrimitive` allows us to describe object to primitive conversion. We'll see its use very soon.

Other symbols will also become familiar when we study the corresponding language features.

#### Symbol.prototype.description
- read-only property
- It returns a string that provides a description of the symbol. This description is the one that was provided when the symbol was created.
```
// Creating a symbol with a description
const mySymbol = Symbol('This is a custom symbol');

// Accessing the description using Symbol.prototype.description
const symbolDescription = mySymbol.description;

console.log(symbolDescription);
// Output: "This is a custom symbol"
```
if no description was provided when creating the symbol, or if the symbol was created before the description property was introduced, the result will be undefined.
```
// Creating a symbol without a description
const anotherSymbol = Symbol();

// Accessing the description of a symbol without a description
const anotherSymbolDescription = anotherSymbol.description;

console.log(anotherSymbolDescription);
// Output: undefined
```
This property is useful when you want to associate additional information or metadata with a symbol, making it more human-readable or providing context about its purpose. It’s important to use the description property judiciously, as it's mainly intended for debugging and development purposes and not for critical program logic.
