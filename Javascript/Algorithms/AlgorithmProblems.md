- Wherefore art thou
```
Make a function that looks through an array of objects (first argument) and returns an array of all objects that have matching name and value pairs (second argument). Each name and value pair of the source object has to be present in the object from the collection if it is to be included in the returned array.

For example, if the first argument is [{ first: "Romeo", last: "Montague" }, { first: "Mercutio", last: null }, { first: "Tybalt", last: "Capulet" }], and the second argument is { last: "Capulet" }, then you must return the third object from the array (the first argument), because it contains the name and its value, that was passed on as the second argument.

function whatIsInAName(collection, source) {
  const arr = [];
  // Only change code below this line


  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}

whatIsInAName([{ first: "Romeo", last: "Montague" }, { first: "Mercutio", last: null }, { first: "Tybalt", last: "Capulet" }], { last: "Capulet" });

- Spinal Tap Case
```
Convert a string to spinal case. Spinal case is all-lowercase-words-joined-by-dashes.

function spinalCase(str) {
  return str;
}

spinalCase('This Is Spinal Tap');
```
- Pig Latin
```
Pig Latin is a way of altering English Words. The rules are as follows:

- If a word begins with a consonant, take the first consonant or consonant cluster, move it to the end of the word, and add ay to it.

- If a word begins with a vowel, just add way at the end.

Tasks
Translate the provided string to Pig Latin. Input strings are guaranteed to be English words in all lowercase.

function translatePigLatin(str) {
  return str;
}

translatePigLatin("consonant");
```
- Search and Replace
```
Perform a search and replace on the sentence using the arguments provided and return the new sentence.

First argument is the sentence to perform the search and replace on.

Second argument is the word that you will be replacing (before).

Third argument is what you will be replacing the second argument with (after).

Note: Preserve the case of the first character in the original word when you are replacing it. For example if you mean to replace the word Book with the word dog, it should be replaced as Dog

function myReplace(str, before, after) {
  return str;
}

myReplace("A quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog", "jumped", "leaped");
```
- DNA Pairing
```
Pairs of DNA strands consist of nucleobase pairs. Base pairs are represented by the characters AT and CG, which form building blocks of the DNA double helix.

The DNA strand is missing the pairing element. Write a function to match the missing base pairs for the provided DNA strand. For each character in the provided string, find the base pair character. Return the results as a 2d array.

For example, for the input GCG, return [["G", "C"], ["C","G"], ["G", "C"]]

The character and its pair are paired up in an array, and all the arrays are grouped into one encapsulating array.

function pairElement(str) {
  return str;
}

pairElement("GCG");
```
- Missing letters
```
Find the missing letter in the passed letter range and return it.

If all letters are present in the range, return undefined.
function fearNotLetter(str) {
  return str;
}

fearNotLetter("abce");
```
- Sorted Union
```
Find the missing letter in the passed letter range and return it.

If all letters are present in the range, return undefined.

function fearNotLetter(str) {
  return str;
}

fearNotLetter("abce");
```
- Convert HTML Entities
```
Convert the characters &, <, >, " (double quote), and ' (apostrophe), in a string to their corresponding HTML entities.
function convertHTML(str) {
  return str;
}

convertHTML("Dolce & Gabbana");
```
- Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers
```
Given a positive integer num, return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to num.

The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1. Every additional number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8.

For example, sumFibs(10) should return 10 because all odd Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to 10 are 1, 1, 3, and 5.
function sumFibs(num) {
  return num;
}

sumFibs(4);
```
- Sum All Primes
```
A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 with exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 2. In contrast, 4 is not prime since it is divisible by 1, 2 and 4.

Rewrite sumPrimes so it returns the sum of all prime numbers that are less than or equal to num.
function sumPrimes(num) {
  return num;
}

sumPrimes(10);
```
- Smallest Common Multiple
```
Find the smallest common multiple of the provided parameters that can be evenly divided by both, as well as by all sequential numbers in the range between these parameters.

The range will be an array of two numbers that will not necessarily be in numerical order.

For example, if given 1 and 3, find the smallest common multiple of both 1 and 3 that is also evenly divisible by all numbers between 1 and 3. The answer here would be 6.

function smallestCommons(arr) {
  return arr;
}

smallestCommons([1,5]);
```
- Drop it
```
Given the array arr, iterate through and remove each element starting from the first element (the 0 index) until the function func returns true when the iterated element is passed through it.

Then return the rest of the array once the condition is satisfied, otherwise, arr should be returned as an empty array.
function dropElements(arr, func) {
  return arr;
}

dropElements([1, 2, 3], function(n) {return n < 3; });
```
- Steamroller
```
Flatten a nested array. You must account for varying levels of nesting.

function steamrollArray(arr) {
  return arr;
}

steamrollArray([1, [2], [3, [[4]]]]);
```
- Binary Agents
```
Return an English translated sentence of the passed binary string.

The binary string will be space separated.
function binaryAgent(str) {
  return str;
}

binaryAgent("01000001 01110010 01100101 01101110 00100111 01110100 00100000 01100010 01101111 01101110 01100110 01101001 01110010 01100101 01110011 00100000 01100110 01110101 01101110 00100001 00111111");
```
- Everything Be True
```
Check if the predicate (second argument) is truthy on all elements of a collection (first argument).

In other words, you are given an array collection of objects. The predicate pre will be an object property and you need to return true if its value is truthy. Otherwise, return false.

In JavaScript, truthy values are values that translate to true when evaluated in a Boolean context.

Remember, you can access object properties through either dot notation or [] notation.
function truthCheck(collection, pre) {
  return pre;
}

truthCheck([{name: "Quincy", role: "Founder", isBot: false}, {name: "Naomi", role: "", isBot: false}, {name: "Camperbot", role: "Bot", isBot: true}], "isBot");
```
- Arguments Optional
```
Create a function that sums two arguments together. If only one argument is provided, then return a function that expects one argument and returns the sum.

For example, addTogether(2, 3) should return 5, and addTogether(2) should return a function.

Calling this returned function with a single argument will then return the sum:

var sumTwoAnd = addTogether(2);
sumTwoAnd(3) returns 5.

If either argument isn't a valid number, return undefined.
function addTogether() {
  return false;
}

addTogether(2,3);
```
- Make a Person
```
Fill in the object constructor with the following methods below:

getFirstName()
getLastName()
getFullName()
setFirstName(first)
setLastName(last)
setFullName(firstAndLast)
Run the tests to see the expected output for each method. The methods that take an argument must accept only one argument and it has to be a string. These methods must be the only available means of interacting with the object.

const Person = function(firstAndLast) {
  // Only change code below this line
  // Complete the method below and implement the others similarly
  this.getFullName = function() {
    return "";
  };
  return firstAndLast;
};

const bob = new Person('Bob Ross');
bob.getFullName();

- Caesars Cipher
```
One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.

Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.

rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC");
```
- Telephone Number Validator
```
Return true if the passed string looks like a valid US phone number.

The user may fill out the form field any way they choose as long as it has the format of a valid US number. The following are examples of valid formats for US numbers (refer to the tests below for other variants):

555-555-5555
(555)555-5555
(555) 555-5555
555 555 5555
5555555555
1 555 555 5555
For this challenge you will be presented with a string such as 800-692-7753 or 8oo-six427676;laskdjf. Your job is to validate or reject the US phone number based on any combination of the formats provided above. The area code is required. If the country code is provided, you must confirm that the country code is 1. Return true if the string is a valid US phone number; otherwise return false.

telephoneCheck("555-555-5555");
```
- Cash Register
```
Design a cash register drawer function checkCashRegister() that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument.

cid is a 2D array listing available currency.

The checkCashRegister() function should always return an object with a status key and a change key.

Return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []} if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due, or if you cannot return the exact change.

Return {status: "CLOSED", change: [...]} with cash-in-drawer as the value for the key change if it is equal to the change due.

Otherwise, return {status: "OPEN", change: [...]}, with the change due in coins and bills, sorted in highest to lowest order, as the value of the change key.

Currency Unit	Amount
Penny	$0.01 (PENNY)
Nickel	$0.05 (NICKEL)
Dime	$0.1 (DIME)
Quarter	$0.25 (QUARTER)
Dollar	$1 (ONE)
Five Dollars	$5 (FIVE)
Ten Dollars	$10 (TEN)
Twenty Dollars	$20 (TWENTY)
One-hundred Dollars	$100 (ONE HUNDRED)
See below for an example of a cash-in-drawer array:

[
  ["PENNY", 1.01],
  ["NICKEL", 2.05],
  ["DIME", 3.1],
  ["QUARTER", 4.25],
  ["ONE", 90],
  ["FIVE", 55],
  ["TEN", 20],
  ["TWENTY", 60],
  ["ONE HUNDRED", 100]
]

function checkCashRegister(price, cash, cid) {
  let change;
  return change;
}

checkCashRegister(19.5, 20, [["PENNY", 1.01], ["NICKEL", 2.05], ["DIME", 3.1], ["QUARTER", 4.25], ["ONE", 90], ["FIVE", 55], ["TEN", 20], ["TWENTY", 60], ["ONE HUNDRED", 100]]);
