Code Architecture
@CodeArchitectureWithRahul‚Ä¢875 subscribers
I'm Rahul Nikam, a person behind Code Architecture, I have 3 years of experience in this tech field. There are many reason to start this Youtube channel but mostly the reasons are: 1. Only Few will teach you Microservice Architecture. 2. Many people can design scalable systems, but few explain how to code them. 3. You with to use AWS services. but you exactly don't know how to Integrate those. 4. People might wanted to build production ready applications, but confused how to start with! 5. Everyone will teach you what is useMemo and useCallback, But Im here to teach you how you can use them in your project. 6. You create projects with Monolithic Architecture, but I'm here to teach you how to create projects in Microservices architecture. Beginners and experienced developers alike struggle to find comprehensive resources. Code Architecture is here to bridge that gap! #microservicesarchitecture #coding #codearchitecture #frontend #backend #systemdesign #aws Subscribe us ‚ú®‚ù£Ô∏è

However we would not like to restrict ourselves to only mobile application development and would like to evolve as per the viewers tastes and preferences and feedback. You will see demo videos of the some of the mobile apps that I myself have created and hosted on Google Play. I will also provide some of the tutorial videos on topics which I myself find exciting enough. Then based on the feedback provided by the viewers I will add the more videos and that will also help me provide the direction that this channel would like to take.

I‚Äôm Daulat Hussain, a Full-Stack blockchain developer, teacher, and the founder & CEO of The Blockchain Coders. 1 - 1 Consultancy: https://www.theblockchaincoders.com/consultancy When I started coding, I was struggling. I landed an internship and had to use React for a project, but I didn‚Äôt know how. I turned to countless courses and books, but they only taught theory. Nothing helped. The courses left me confused, bored, demotivated, and helpless. They taught concepts‚Ä¶but none of them taught me how to use those concepts to make something real. Many days I was unable to write even a single line of code. I was so close to giving up. My love for coding was the only thing keeping me going. After a lot of trial and error and unending frustration, I finally discovered the best way to learn to code & amaz by Web3 technology, so I decided to learn blockchain development, at the start did know how to start. The answer?

Hello there! During the day, I work as a security consultant and trainer. My remaining time is dedicated to master the art of teaching. I focus on teaching Computer Science, Cybersecurity and Programming. My approach to teaching is pragmatic, and all my lectures share the same underlying objective: help students build intuition by balancing big-picture ideas with in-depth technical details. I put a lot of effort and care into exposing students to practical situations in order to build deep understanding. My belief is that topics, by themselves, are not confusing. Explanations are confusing. I work to explore and construct the best explanation possible for understanding each topic. If you want to support my work, you can subscribe to the channel.

npm inc. is a company founded in 2014, and was acquired by GitHub in 2020. npm continues to be the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well. npm consists of three distinct components: - a website - a registry - a command line interface (CLI) Use the website to discover packages, set up profiles, and manage other aspects of your npm experience. For example, you can set up organizations to manage access to public or private packages. The registry is a large public database of JavaScript software and the meta-information surrounding it. The CLI runs from a terminal, and is how most developers interact with npm.

Hi Guys, I have Always been asked to share my code which I use in my video. Answering people‚Äôs questions is great, and the feeling you get when you solve a problem always felt good. The only problem I have is making tutorials is a little bit time consuming. It requires planning the subjects that need to be covered, recording the tutorial, editing the video, rendering it and finally uploading it on YouTube. So I need your help in Collecting All the codes at one place. I made a website Codebind.com for sharing my code and other programming stuff. But I alone can not do this. So Ask you guys to become contributor to this site. Just Share the code Which you learn by watching Programming Knowledge or You can simply share your Programming Knowledge with others. What is your Benefit? 1 - Together we can collect all the codes of All my videos and share it with others. 2 - Sharing Knowledge is the biggest learning. By sharing You can understand the concepts better. CodeBind.com

Swashbuckling with Code is about the fun and struggles of software development.

I want to show new and experienced developers that it's normal to have gaps in your knowledge by being transparent about things I don't know while I show all the things I do. I've accumulated so much experience over the years, and helped mentor developers I work with, but no matter how much I learn, I'm always surprised by how much I still don't know.

70+ System design Interview Questions with a FAANG Senior Engineer üìö "Why do you do so many different approaches to the problems?" My intended audience is senior+ level engineers. Unlike with mid-level rounds where quickly regurgitating a template you had memorized the night before is "acceptable", senior level interviews are typically tailored and personalized by the interviewer, meaning that any "template" that you memorize and regurgitate is just going to lead to failing the interview. "Can you just do some interview style videos?" There's already a wide variety of videos out there in that style that you're welcome to watch instead, but I've never been impressed by what I've seen in them -- even when they're allegedly answered by a "google engineer" or "staff/principal engineer". I'd like to do things like machine count estimates in future videos; however, that seems like a trivial and repetitive process whe n you get the pattern to it.
